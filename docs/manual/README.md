## Build System

## Evidence

This repo produces lots of run artifacts (logs, JSON reports, probe outputs) under `docs/agent-context/research/`.

- By default, these artifacts are **ignored by git** to keep the repo clean.
- Keep only **curated summaries** as Markdown notes (e.g. a short `.md` with conclusions + links/commands).

## Alignment

- [Manifesto crosswalk (goals → runbook → automation)](manifesto-crosswalk.md)
