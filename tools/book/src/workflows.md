# Workflows

These are the holistic workflows this project aims to make repeatable.

The standard loop is:

1. **Observe** (doctor report)
2. **Hypothesize** (why a workaround is needed)
3. **Apply** (minimal, reversible change)
4. **Verify** (probe that confirms the hypothesis)
5. **Retire** (remove hacks when upstream fixes land)
