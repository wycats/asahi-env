# Patch series

This directory contains patch series for third-party upstreams.

Layout:

- `third_party/patches/<project>/<topic>/0001-...patch`

These patches are exported from a local, untracked upstream checkout under `third_party/<project>/` using `git format-patch`.

See `third_party/README.md` for the workflow.
